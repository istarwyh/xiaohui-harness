/**
 * Environment HTTP proxy installation for the running host process.
 *
 * Node's built-in fetch (undici) does not honour `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`
 * environment variables, while this machine's other tools (curl, python,
 * the codex CLI) all route through the local proxy — so on such a network
 * every LLM request from this plugin would fail with a connect timeout.
 * Installing an `EnvHttpProxyAgent` as the global dispatcher makes the host
 * behave like the rest of the system: proxy variables are honoured (with
 * `NO_PROXY` bypassing for localhost and friends), and on a machine with no
 * proxy variables set this is a no-op.

/**
 * Install the env-proxy dispatcher once, when the process environment names
 * a proxy. Safe to call at any plugin load; repeated calls are no-ops.
 * @param log - diagnostic sink (never receives proxy credentials).
